                    <p>Yesterday at CSSConf, we launched Pure- a new CSS library. Phew!
                        Here are the slides from the presentation. Although it looks pretty
                        minimilistic, we've been working on Pure for several months. After
                        many iterations, we have released Pure as a set of small, responsive, CSS
                        modules that you can use in every web project.
