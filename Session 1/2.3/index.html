                <div class="description-wrapper">
                    <p>Italy kicked off the European Championship with a convincing 3-0 victory over Turkey in 
                        Group A at the Olympic Stadium with Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne on target. Roberto 
                        Mancini's side had been frustrated by Turkey's defensive approach in the first half but 
                        broke through in the 53rd minute when a hard-hit cross from Domenico Berardi flew in off 
                        Turkey defender Merih Demiral for an own goal. The Azzurri, now unbeaten in 28 matches, 
                        doubled their lead in the 66th when Leonardo Spinazzola's drive was parried by Turkey 
                        goalkeeper Ugurcan Cakir but Immobile reacted well to slot home the loose ball. Insigne 
                        made it 3-0 in the 79th minute with a confident, curling finish after some sloppy defending 
                        from the disappointing Turks.

                    <p>The leaders of Group of Seven (G7) debated how strongly they should respond to China's growing

                        reportedly became so sensitive at one point that all internet was shut off to the room.

                    <p>A seat on a spaceship ride with billionaire Jeff Bezos went for $28 million 
                        during a live auction on Saturday, concluding the month-long bidding process 
                        for the sightseeing trip on the Blue Origin's maiden voyage next month. <br>
                        Within four minutes of the open of Saturday's live phone auction, bids reached 
                        beyond $20 million. The bidding closed seven minutes after the auction began. 
                        The identity of the winner - presumably an ultra-wealthy space aficionado - was 
                        not immediately disclosed. <br>
